A Dice Rolling Simulator is a fun and interactive software tool that emulates the rolling of dice—perfect for games, probability experiments, or just satisfying that urge to let fate decide! It typically allows users to “roll” one or more dice with a simple tap or click, displaying results instantly.

Here’s what a good simulator usually offers:

🧮 Random Number Generation: Uses a random algorithm to simulate fair and unpredictable rolls, just like physical dice.

🎛️ Customizable Dice: Options to roll different types—like 6-sided (standard), 12-sided for RPGs, or even unusual configurations.

📊 Roll History: Displays past results to track patterns or analyze probability outcomes.
